# YouTube Scripts

## Contents

There are two scripts:

1. **make-latest.sh**
1. **contert-yt.sh**

## Requirements

* [ffmpeg](www.ffmpeg.org).
* The two scripts are in the PATH.
* A bash shell. [GitBash](www.gitbash.org) will do in a pinch.

## Notes

* This all works for me.
* Good luck!

## Future Work

Unfuck the scripts, how they work, and this documentation.
